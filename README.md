# Junit

* JUnit is a popular open-source framework for unit testing in the Java programming language. 
* It provides a straightforward way to write and run repeatable tests, ensuring that code behaves as expected. 
* JUnit is often used in Test-Driven Development (TDD), where tests are written before the code itself, guiding the development process.

## Key features of JUnit include:

- **Annotations**: JUnit uses annotations like `@Test`, `@Before`, `@After`, `@BeforeClass`, `@AfterClass`, and `@Ignore` to define test methods and manage test execution flow.
- **Assertions**: JUnit provides a set of assertion methods to compare expected and actual outcomes. Common assertions include `assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`, `assertNull`, `assertNotNull`, `assertSame`, and `assertThrows`.
- **Test Runners**: JUnit offers different test runners, enabling the execution of tests in various ways. The default runner executes tests one at a time, but others, like `Parameterized`, allow parameterized tests, and `Suite` enables grouping multiple test classes.
- **Test Suites**: JUnit allows you to create test suites to run multiple test classes as a group, facilitating broader testing scenarios.
- **Integration with Build Tools and IDEs**: JUnit seamlessly integrates with popular build tools like Maven and Gradle, as well as integrated development environments (IDEs) like Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.
